# Preface {-}

## You can learn statistics

Many textbooks in mathematics begin with a useful high level overview of the content of the book. We'll get to that in a moment. I want to start this one off a little differently: _You can learn statistics._ I believe that you can learn statistics and I'm happy you have opened this book to do it. Statistics is a wonderful field, and I am excited for you to learn it. I believe in you.

## Why I wrote this book

First and foremost, I wrote this book because I'm excited about statistics (really excited; who writes a textbook for fun?), and I want other people to be excited about statistics too. 

The second and most important reason I wrote this textbook is because I would have appreciated a deeper mathematical understanding when I was learning statistics. Indeed, as a graduate student in Psychology, I became very comfortable with the applied end of statistics. I nevertheless found myself approaching statistics like a recipe book, e.g., if you have this type of data, it should be analyzed in this way. I did eventually pick up semi-mathematical "explanations" for why certain analyses were appropriate, and although these explanations were accurate (in a sense) they were sometimes quite amorphous. I have grown to appreciate the concrete and exact nature of mathematics - particularly the field of mathematical statistics. This book is therefore meant to teach the a deeper mathematical theory _in addition to_ the application of statistics. My hope is that some curious student (like myself long ago) can have their curiosity assuaged.  

## What content to expect in this book

To that end, this book will review many concepts learned in an undergraduate behavioral statistics course, but with more mathematical emphasis. It will proceed in three parts:

1. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 give a background on probability and probability distributions. Within behavioral statistics courses, we often discuss a vaguely defined "population" of study. These three chapters define more concretely what we mean when we refer to a population or populations. Hint: Populations can be thought of as random variables and their corresponding **probability distributions**. We'll dig into this later.

2. Chapter 4 is our first foray into statistical inference. While Chapters 1, 2, and 3 tell us about populations, this chapter will begin our journey of **inferring** some basic things about these probability distributions. We will learn about the **Law of Large Numbers** and the amazing **Central Limit Theorem**. 

3. Chapter 5 (and the chapters thereafter) will introduce us to hypothesis testing - the cornerstone of statistical inference in the behavioral sciences. We will cover several statistical techniques such as _z_-tests, _t_-tests, correlation, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.

Thank you for reading!

## What you'll need to know to get the most out of this book

The most important "thing" you need to read this book is excitement. I would not describe myself personally as a mathematical prodigy in any way. I'm just excited about the subject, and that provides me with the extra boost to understand the difficult stuff. The second thing you'll need is an okay grasp of algebra. If you are rusty, I suspect enough will come back to you to understand everything in this book. I'll try to give gentle reviews where I can throughout. There is lots of content online (like this book) that would offer an awesome review of algebra, so if you are confused and I don't provide a review, you could almost certainly find something to get you up to speed.

## Future editions of this book

This book is a working document. It was created based on some hand written notes I developed whilst teaching my colleagues. I am _still_ teaching my colleagues and I shall try to add chapters in pace with that endeavor. I also plan to work in practice problems and tutorials on R sometime in the future. Stay tuned.
