We’ll get to that in a moment, but I want to start this book off a little differently. You can learn statistics! I believe that you can learn statistics and I’m happy you have opened this book to do it. Statistics is a wonderful field, and I am excited for you to learn it. I believe in you. 1.2 Why I wrote this book First an foremost, I wrote this book because I’m excited about statistics, and because I want to share this excitement with you! Second - and most importantly - the reason I wrote this textbook is because I would have appreciated a book like this as a behavioral scientist learning statistics. Over the years, I became very comfortable with the applied end of statistics, but as a graduate student I found myself approaching statistics like a recipe book, e.g., if you have this type of data, it should be analyzed in this way. Over the course of my studies and career, I picked up “explanations” for why certain analyses were appropriate, and although these explanations were accurate (in a sense) they were sometimes quite amorphous. I have grown to appreciate the concrete and exact nature of mathematics - particularly the field of mathematical statistics. And, as a young graduate student, I would have appreciated a deeper understanding of why in the concrete mathematical sense. As I studied mathematics and mathematical statistics throughout my career, I came to realize that a deeper understanding is within the reach of the graduate student in the behavioral sciences. I decided to write a book that takes a student - perhaps with an okay memory of algebra and maybe with some experience withe calculus (not at all required) - to a more mathematical understanding of statistics. 1.3 What content to expect in this book To that end, this book will review many concepts learned in an undergraduate bevavioraly statistics course, but with more mathematical emphasis. This book can be categorized into three parts: Chapters 1, 2, and 3 give a background on probability and probability distributions. Within behavioral statistics courses, we often discuss a vaguely defined “population” of study. These three chapters define more concretely what we mean by populations. Hint: Populations can be thought of as random variables and their corresponding probability distributions. We’ll dig into this later. Chapter 4 is our first foray into statistical inference. While Chapters 1, 2, and 3 tell us about populations, this chapter will begin our journey of inferring some basic things about these probability distributions. We will learn about the Law of Large Numbers and the amazing Central Limit Theorem. Chapter 5 (and the chapters thereafter) will introduce us to hypothesis testing - the cornerstone of statistical inference in the behavioral sciences. We will cover several statistical techniques such as z-tests, t-tests, correlation, chi-square tests, and ANOVA. Thank you for reading! "],["set-theory-and-probability.html", "Chapter 2 Set Theory and Probability", " Chapter 2 Set Theory and Probability In the course of research, behavioral scientists will often take samples of human behavior, e.g.: A researcher might survey a group of people about their happiness level - with their happiness level characterized on a 10 point scale. A cognitive researcher may measure how much time a person takes to recall something. An educational researcher might take a sample of course grades. The examples are numerous and frequent, and throughout the course of your career, you will take many samples.
