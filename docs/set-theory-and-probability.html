<p>In the course of research, behavioral scientists will often take samples of human behavior, e.g. a survey of a group of people, measurements of reaction time, etc. These samples will take some <em>outcome</em>, and most of us understand and have observed the inherent randomness of this act. That is to say, you might take the exact same sample in a carefully controlled circumstance and get different results every time.</p>
<p>Statisticians often refer to an analogous circumstance when talking about probability. Suppose we are able to describe all the possible outcomes of our sampling procedure. We take samples over and over again in the same circumstances, and each time the outcome changes. This is referred to as a <strong>random experiment</strong>. In order to familiarize you with some introductory concepts around probability, we’re going to start in this context of a random experiment. First, we’ll learn about sets and set theory in order to describe our <strong>sample space</strong>. This will also be useful in describing the form that outcomes of a random experiment may take. Then we’ll more concretely define the randomness of our experiment by talking about <strong>probability</strong> - the quantification of randomness.</p>
<div id="sets-and-basic-set-theory" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Sets and Basic Set Theory<a href="set-theory-and-probability.html#sets-and-basic-set-theory" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Before we get into it, we aren’t going to learn set theory in it’s entirety. That would be overly (and hilariously) ambitious. What we are going to learn will make understanding later sections easier, and maybe it’ll make it a bit easier to understand set notation in other circumstances. The first step in conducting a random experiment is clearly defining all the possible outcomes of your sampling procedure. This is referred to as the <strong>sample space</strong>. Suppose we have five different possible outcomes in our sample space: A, B, C, D, and E. Let’s call it <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Then we would describe it like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:discreteset">\[
S = \{A, B, C, D, E\}
\tag{2.1}
\]</span>
That is to say we’ll describe the set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with curly braces, and on the inside of the curly braces, there shall be a list of <em>distinct</em> elements of our set. The sample space above is <strong>discrete</strong> - meaning it either contains a finite number of elements or it is <em>countable</em>. Here the sample space is finite (it has five elements). That’s pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the definition of countable can be tricky to grasp at first, and if you don’t understand it here, my hope is you can gain a small intuition for it. Specifically, a discrete sample space can also contain an <em>infinite</em> number of elements - so long as those elements can be lined up one-to-one with the natural numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, …). This is probably not the most intuitive definition for people who don’t think about mathematics every day (it certainly wasn’t for me). In another, more intuitive sense, a discrete sample space - finite or infinite - has elements with nothing in between them. In <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> above, there is nothing in between A and B, for example. If your discrete set had an infinite number of elements, you could also find nothing between the first and second elements (or any given sequential pair).</p>
<p>With that side point out of the way, we may also find ourselves sampling from a <strong>continuous</strong> sample space, e.g. all the values between and including 0 and 1 (e.g <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq x \leq 1\)</span>). Since you can’t enumerate all the values of a continuous sample space as we did <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (people have “tried”; we’ll talk about one such example later), we use a different form of notation. Suppose we have a continuous sample space <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, then we would specify it as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:continuousset">\[
T = \{x\, | \, 0 \leq x \leq 1 \}
\tag{2.2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The inclusion criteria for the set is written after the <span class="math inline">\(|\)</span> in the curly braces. The <span class="math inline">\(|\)</span> can be read loosely as meaning “where”, so reading the whole thing in the curly braces left to right you get x <em>where</em> <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq x \leq 1\)</span>. Therefore, our set is all the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s from 0 to 1.</p>
<p>Now that we have discussed some more concrete ways of describing our sample space, let’s talk about sampling from it. Suppose we are randomly drawing a single item from our sample space <span class="math inline">\(S = \{A, B, C, D, E\}\)</span>. We shall call a particular outcome an <em>event</em>. Events are described by a <em>subset</em> of the sample space. For example, we might say the event is <span class="math inline">\(C = \{A, B, C\}\)</span>, and if our sample lands in the that subset (as either A, B, or C), then we shall say the event “occurred”. For the sake of brevity, and positivity, I will referred to the occurrence of an event as a “success” (congratulations all around!). You can indicate a set is a subset of another set by:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:subset">\[ C \subset S
\tag{2.3} \]</span></p>
<p>We might also, for example say that our event is a single element <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A\}\)</span> or the entire sample space <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{A,B,C,D,E\}\)</span>. We can be as creative as we would like to be, so long as the event is in our sample space. Speaking of creativity, suppose we have two events <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A,B,C\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{B,C,D\}\)</span>, and we are interested in whether or not our randomly sampled element lands in <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>. It’s helpful here to consider the circumstances where this event occurs. Namely, If our realized element was an A, B, C, or D, then we would be successful (success!). That is to say, we’ve taken all the unique elements of either set and combined them into a new set. If our sample lands in that new subset, we can be confident that <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span> occurred. There’s a handy symbol that indicates this operation:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:union">\[ C_1 \cup C_1 = \{A,B,C\}\:\cup\:\{B,C,D\} = \{A,B,C,D\}
\tag{2.4} \]</span></p>
<p>This <em>union operator</em> (<span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span>) takes the unique elements of both sets and puts them into a set of their own. In this circumstance it is used synonymous with <em>or</em>. If the event of interest is our sample landing in <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> OR <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>, then we would be successful if the event landed in the union of the two sets, e.g. all the unique elements from both sets. Here’s another example, suppose we are interested in if our sample falls into $ C_1 = {A} $ or $ C_2 = {B} $. Then our event would occur if the element was A or B:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{A\}\:\cup\:\{B\} = \{A,B\} \]</span>
Since we’re being creative, let’s consider another scenario (and a new operator!). Suppose we have our two previously described events - <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A,B,C\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{B,C,D\}\)</span> - each a subset of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Lets further say that we are interested in whether or both events occur when we sample our element. That is, we shall be successful if our element falls in both <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>. We are therefore interested in the <em>shared</em> elements of our two events. If we draw a B or C, then we would be successful, but an A or D would be bad news for us because each is unique to a set! The <em>intersect operator</em> will help us signify this process:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:intersect">\[ C_1 \cap C_2 = \{A,B,C\} \cap \{B,C,D\} = \{B,C\}
\tag{2.5}\]</span></p>
<p>Unlike <span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span>, the intersect operator represents <strong>and</strong>. That is to say, if we are interested in the occurrence of one event AND another (a.k.a., our sample landing in both events), then the intersect is used. This operator can create some interesting conundrums, so it’s worthwhile to do another example. This time let’s define our sets to be <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = {A,B}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = {C,D}\)</span>. Now we’re interested in whether or not our sample falls in <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ C_1 \cap C_2 = \{A, B\} \cap \{C, D\} = \{\} \]</span></p>
<p>Wow, wait a second, what happened there? The answer is our two sets had no overlap. You couldn’t possibly draw a single element that landed in <em>both</em> the sets. As a result, we get a very special set - the <em>null set</em> - <span class="math inline">\(\{\}\)</span>. The null set is a subset of every set, and is a set with no elements. It’s fun and interesting to see how it works with our operators. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{A,B,C,D,E\} \cap \{\} = \{\} \]</span></p>
<p>The null set intersected with any other set is itself. In a way, intersecting the empty set with any other set is like multiplying something by zero. The null set intersected with another set is the null set, zero multiplied by another number is zero. Next, what do you suppose happens when we union the null set with something else? Let’s try it out:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{A,B,C,D,E\} \cup \{\} = \{A,B,C,D,E\} \]</span></p>
<p>A set unioned with the null set is itself. Indeed, this is similar to multiplying another number by 1.</p>
<p>To this point we’ve learned how to describe our sample space, the concept of an event, how to create new events with union/intersect (or/and) operators, and the fancy null set. That’s about all we need. I would like to finish out this brief section on sets with a discussion of the <em>complement</em> of a subset and a brief treatment of how these operators work in the continuous case.</p>
<p>The continuous case is pretty much the same although it takes some drawing of number lines if you are rusty with inequalities (no problem). Suppose we are sampling from a sample space <span class="math inline">\(S = \{x\,|\,0 \leq x \leq 10 \}\)</span> and we are interested in if the event lands in <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{x\,|\,0 \leq x \leq 2 \}\)</span> OR <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{x\,|\,2 \leq x \leq 5 \}\)</span>. A successful sample here would occur if our sample landed anywhere from zero to five. In other words:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{0 \leq x \leq 2 \}\:\cup\:\{2 \leq x \leq 5\} = \{0 \leq x \leq 5\} \]</span></p>
