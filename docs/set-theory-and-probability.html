<p>In the course of research, behavioral scientists will often take samples of human behavior, e.g. a survey of a group of people, measurements of reaction time, etc. These samples will take some <em>outcome</em>, and most of us understand and have observed the inherent randomness of this act. That is to say, you might take the exact same sample in a carefully controlled circumstance and get different results every time.</p>
<p>Statisticians often refer to an analogous circumstance when talking about probability. Suppose we are able to describe all the possible outcomes of our sampling procedure. We take samples over and over again in the same circumstances, and each time the outcome changes. This is referred to as a <strong>random experiment</strong>. In order to familiarize you with some introductory concepts around probability, we’re going to start in this context of a random experiment. First, we’ll learn about sets and set theory in order to describe our <strong>sample space</strong>. This will also be useful in describing the form that outcomes of a random experiment may take. Then we’ll more concretely define the randomness of our experiment by talking about <strong>probability</strong> - the quantification of randomness.</p>
<div id="sets-and-sample-spaces" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Sets and Sample Spaces<a href="set-theory-and-probability.html#sets-and-sample-spaces" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Before we get into it, we aren’t going to learn set theory in it’s entirety. That would be overly (and hilariously) ambitious. What we are going to learn will make understanding later sections easier, get your brain warmed up, and make it a bit easier to understand set notation in other circumstances. The first step in conducting a random experiment is clearly defining all the possible outcomes of your sampling procedure. This is referred to as the <strong>sample space</strong>. Suppose we have five different possible outcomes in our sample space: A, B, C, D, and E. Let’s call this sample space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Then we would describe it like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:discreteset">\[
S = \{A, B, C, D, E\}
\tag{2.1}
\]</span>
That is to say we’ll describe the set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with curly braces, and on the inside of the curly braces, there shall be a list of <em>distinct</em> elements of our set. The sample space above is an example of a <strong>discrete</strong> sample space - meaning it either contains a finite number of elements or it is <em>countable</em>. In this case, the sample space has a finite number of elements (five to be exact), so we can call it discrete.</p>
<p>On the other hand, describing a countable, but not necessarily finite, sample space can be tricky. My hope is you can gain a small sense for it from my explanation here. We’ll see examples of it later. Specifically, a discrete sample space can also contain an <em>infinite</em> number of elements - so long as those elements can be lined up one-to-one with the natural numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, …). That is, the elements can be “counted”, albeit infinitely and forever. This is probably not the most intuitive definition for people who don’t think about mathematics every day (it certainly wasn’t for me). In another, more intuitive sense, a discrete sample space - finite or infinite - has elements with nothing in between them. In <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> above, there is nothing in between A and B, for example. If your discrete set had an infinite number of elements, you could line them up (arbitrarily) with the natural numbers. And, after this alignment, you could find nothing between the first and second elements (or any given sequential pair for that matter).</p>
<p>With that point out of the way, we may also find ourselves sampling from a <strong>continuous</strong> sample space, e.g., all the values between and including 0 and 1 (e.g <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq x \leq 1\)</span>). Since you can’t enumerate all the values of a continuous sample space as we did with <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (people have “tried”; we’ll talk about one such example later), we use a different form of notation. Suppose we have a continuous sample space <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, then we would specify it as</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:continuousset">\[
R = \{x\, | \, 0 \leq x \leq 1 \}
\tag{2.2}
\]</span></p>
<p>The inclusion criteria for the set is written after the <span class="math inline">\(|\)</span> in the curly braces. The <span class="math inline">\(|\)</span> can be read loosely as meaning “where”, so reading the whole thing in the curly braces left to right you get x <em>where</em> <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq x \leq 1\)</span>. Therefore, our set is all the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s from 0 to 1. Note that I will occasionally drop the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|\)</span> when it is clear what variable I am referencing. As an aside, continuous sample spaces can be found everywhere in the field of behavioral statistics. For reasons that will become apparent later, we shall nonetheless discuss these spaces with slightly less mathematical depth.</p>
<p>Having discussed discrete and continuous sample spaces, it is now time to turn our attention towards sampling. Suppose we are randomly drawing a single item from our sample space <span class="math inline">\(S = \{A, B, C, D, E\}\)</span>. The <em>outcome</em> of our experiment is a single item from our sample space, and we will talk about outcomes in terms of <em>events</em>. Events are described by a <em>subset</em> of the sample space. That is, they may be one or more outcomes combined. For example, we might say the event is <span class="math inline">\(C = \{A, B, C\}\)</span>, and if our outcome lands in the that subset (as either A, B, or C), then we shall say the event “occurred”. For the sake of brevity, and positivity, I will referred to the occurrence of an event as a “success” (congratulations all around!). You can indicate a set is a subset by:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:subset">\[ C \subset S
\tag{2.3} \]</span></p>
<p>In this case, we are saying <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. We might also, for example say that our event is a single element/outcome <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A\}\)</span> or the entire sample space <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{A,B,C,D,E\}\)</span>. We can be as creative as we would like to be, so long as the event is in our sample space.</p>
<p>Indeed, in practice we might want to get a little more creative in terms of the outcomes of our random experiment. Let’s talk about a slightly more complicated scenario. Suppose we have two events <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A,B,C\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{B,C,D\}\)</span>, and we are interested in whether or not our outcome lands in <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>. It’s helpful here to consider the circumstances where this event occurs. Namely, If our outcome was an A, B, C, or D, then we would be successful (success!). That is to say, we’ve taken all the unique outcomes of either set and combined them into a new set. If our outcome lands in that new subset, we can be confident that <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span> occurred. There’s a handy symbol that indicates this operation:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:union">\[ C_1 \cup C_2 = \{A,B,C\}\:\cup\:\{B,C,D\} = \{A,B,C,D\}
\tag{2.4} \]</span></p>
<p>This <em>union operator</em> (<span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span>) takes the unique elements of both sets and puts them into a set of their own. In this circumstance it is used synonymously with <em>or</em>. If the event of interest is our outcome landing in <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> OR <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>, then we would be successful if the event landed in the union of the two sets, e.g., all the unique elements from both sets. Here’s another example, suppose we are interested in if our outcome falls into <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A\}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{B\}\)</span>. Then our event would occur if the element was A or B:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{A\}\:\cup\:\{B\} = \{A,B\} \]</span>
Since we’re being creative, let’s consider another scenario (and a new operator!). Suppose we have our two previously described events - <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A,B,C\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{B,C,D\}\)</span> - each a subset of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Lets further say that we are interested in whether or not both events occur when we sample. That is, we shall be successful if our outcome falls in both <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>. We are therefore interested in the <em>shared</em> elements of our two events. If we draw a B or C, then we would be successful, but an A or D would be bad news for us because each is unique to a set! The <em>intersect operator</em> will help us signify this process:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:intersect">\[ C_1 \cap C_2 = \{A,B,C\} \cap \{B,C,D\} = \{B,C\}
\tag{2.5}\]</span></p>
<p>Unlike <span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span>, the intersect operator represents <strong>and</strong>. That is to say, if we are interested in the occurrence of one event AND another (a.k.a., our outcome landing in both events), then the intersect is used. This operator can create some interesting conundrums, so it’s worthwhile to do another example or two. This time let’s define our events to be <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A,B\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{C,D\}\)</span>. Now we’re interested in whether or not our outcome falls in <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span> (What do you think is going to happen here?):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ C_1 \cap C_2 = \{A, B\} \cap \{C, D\} = \{\} \]</span></p>
<p>Wow, that was an interesting result! Our two sets had no overlap. You couldn’t possibly draw a single element that landed in <em>both</em> the sets. The are two lessons to learn from this. First, we get a very special set - a <em>null set</em> - <span class="math inline">\(\{\}\)</span> - which is a set with zero elements. Second, when the intersect of sets results in a null set (a.k.a. they have no overlap), we shall refer to them as being <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> - because the two sets do not share elements.</p>
<p>Regarding the former point, it’s fun and interesting to see how a null set works with our operators. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{A,B,C,D,E\} \cap \{\} = \{\} \]</span></p>
<p>A null set intersected with any other set is itself. A set with something in it can share nothing with a set that has no elements at all. In a way, intersecting the empty set with any other set is like multiplying a number by zero. On the other hand, what do you suppose happens when we union a null set with something else? Let’s try it out:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{A,B,C,D,E\} \cup \{\} = \{A,B,C,D,E\} \]</span></p>
<p>A set unioned with a null set is itself. A null set has nothing unique to add to our “something set”. Although the null set is really cool (in my opinion; and I hope your opinion too), working with it is, metaphorically speaking, like talking to the most boring person in the world. You have nothing in common with them (<span class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span>), and they have nothing to add (<span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span>). And, with that, you have learned your first set theory insult.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we’ve learned how to describe our sample space, the concept of an outcome and event, how to create new events with union/intersect (or/and) operators, and the fancy null set. That’s about all we need. I would like to finish out this brief section on sets with a discussion of the <em>complement</em> of a subset and a brief treatment of how the previously mentioned operators work in the continuous case.</p>
<p>The complement of a subset describes all the elements of a sample space <em>not</em> in that subset. For the sake of consistency, we’ll keep using our sample space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> <a href="set-theory-and-probability.html#eq:discreteset">(2.1)</a>, and let’s work with <span class="math inline">\(Y = \{A,B,C\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(Y\subset S\)</span>. The complement of that subset in the sample space would be <span class="math inline">\(\{D, E\}\)</span>. The operation of taking the complement of a subset is indicated by:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:complement">\[ Y^c = \{A,B,C\}^c = \{D,E\}
\tag{2.6}\]</span></p>
<p>The complement allows for a wider breadth of operations. Let’s again consider our sample space <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Suppose we were interested in an event that was NOT in the two subsets <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{A,B\}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C_2 =\{C,D\}\)</span>. The first thing we would do in this circumstance is maybe consider all the ways our outcome could be unsuccessful (we won’t use “fail” here; too negative). It would be unsuccessful if it landed in <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>. Recall that the <span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span> (union) gives us the unique elements in both sets. Let’s take these two sets and union them into a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> together.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ C_1 \cup C_2 = \{A,B,C,D\} = X \]</span></p>
<p>Now that we have our subset of unsuccessful elements, we just take the complement of that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ X^c = \{E\} \]</span></p>
<p>Of course, you might have known the answer to this all along, but it’s nice to see the steps broken down exactly. You could have written it all in one go using parentheses to specify order of operations, e.g.:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (C_1 \cup C_2)^c = \{A, B, C, D\}^c = \{E\} \]</span></p>
<p>Notice how we do the operation in the parentheses before taking the complement. Let’s try one more example with <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>. Let’s say we defined a successful outcome as all the things NOT in <span class="math inline">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2\)</span>. Notice the key word “and”. Our list of unsuccessful items will be different this time because we are referring to the shared (intersect) of both our subsets. Therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ (C_1 \cap C_2)^c = \{\}^c = \{A,B,C,D,E\} \]</span></p>
<p>The two sets have no overlap, so their intersect is a null set, and the complement of the null set is all the elements in our sample space.</p>
<p>With a good understanding of some of the basic operators and sets, let’s turn to a brief treatment of the continuous sample space. The continuous case is very similar to the discrete case - although it takes some drawing of number lines if you are rusty with inequalities (no problem). Suppose we are sampling from a sample space <span class="math inline">\(S = \{x\,|\,0 \leq x \leq 10 \}\)</span> and we are interested in if the outcome lands in <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{x\,|\,0 \leq x \leq 2 \}\)</span> OR <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{x\,|\,2 \leq x \leq 5 \}\)</span>. A successful outcome here would occur if our realized element landed anywhere from zero to five. In other words:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{0 \leq x \leq 2 \}\:\cup\:\{2 \leq x \leq 5\} = \{0 \leq x \leq 5\} \]</span></p>
<p>Let’s keep the same continuous sample space and subsets as above, and this time let’s look at the intersect of the two sets:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{0 \leq x \leq 2 \}\:\cap\:\{2 \leq x \leq 5\} = \{2\} \]</span></p>
<p>The two sets only overlap at exactly <span class="math inline">\(x = 2\)</span>, so their intersect is just a set with the value 2. Let’s do a couple more so you can get a sense for it. Suppose we have a sample space <span class="math inline">\(Q = \{x\,|\, 5 \leq x \leq 10\}\)</span> and define <span class="math inline">\(C \subset Q\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C = \{x\,|\, 5 \leq x &lt; 7\}\)</span>. That is to say, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a subset of Q, and its interval includes the lower side (5) but it doesn’t include the upper side (7). What is the complement?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ C^c = \{5 \leq x &lt; 7\}^c = \{7 \leq x \leq 10\} \]</span></p>
<p>The complement includes 7 up to 10. In the plot below, you can see a visual depiction of this. The top line represents the subset <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and the bottom line represents the complement. The open circle at the end of our subset <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> indicates that the value 7 is not included in its range. The elements of C are strictly less than 7. This is in contrast to the complement line below - which has a solid black dot indicating 7’s inclusion due to its exclusion from <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Thus the complement of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> ranges from 7 to 10.</p>
<p><img src="_main_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>One more comment is worth a mention with regards to continuous sample spaces. Suppose we have two subsets of our space <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> that don’t overlap in any way. For example, take <span class="math inline">\(C_1 = \{x\,|\, 5 \leq x &lt; 7\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C_2 = \{x\,|\, 9 \leq x \leq 10\}\)</span>. Then you would simply write their union as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \{\, 5 \leq x &lt; 7\} \cup \{\, 9 \leq x \leq 10\}\]</span>
There is no simplified way to write this in set notation. Note the intersect of these two sets would be <span class="math inline">\(\{\}\)</span> - a null set.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Repeated Samples and Sets<a href="set-theory-and-probability.html#repeated-samples-and-sets" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The previous introduction to sets was dedicated to a random experiment where we only draw a single element from our sample space. In practice, researchers and statisticians are often sampling repeatedly. In this section we’ll talk about how to describe the sample space of an experiment that involves multiple draws. Note, for the purposes of our learning, we shall only be discussing sampling with <em>replacement</em>. That is, we will be talking about circumstances where the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, … , nth outcome gets returned to the sample space prior to the next draw. This is opposed to the circumstance where an outcome of a single sample reduces the size of the sample space each time. For example, suppose we have a sample space, <span class="math inline">\(S = \{A,B,C\}\)</span>. On our first experiment, we randomly draw an <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In sampling without replacement, the sampling space for the next draw would be <span class="math inline">\(\{B,C\}\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(\{A\}^c)\)</span> and in sampling with replacement <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> would be returned to the space.</p>
<p>To understand how to describe the sample spaces mentioned above, we’ll turn to a good-old-fashioned coin toss (the mainstay of every introductory probability book). Suppose we perform a single flip (experiment) from a fair coin. Our sample space would be <span class="math inline">\(S = \{H, T\}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is “heads”, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is “tails”. Now let’s suppose we conduct two flips. The sample space would be all the possible permutations of heads and tails from the two flips. It helps to draw draw a <em>tree diagram</em> to get the gist of it.</p>
<p><img src="_main_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>You can follow the branches of the tree above to see each possible permutation of the two flips. For example, suppose the first flip was heads, you would follow the line at the first node (on the left) up the the “H” (heads) node. Then at the “heads” node, the next flip could either be an “H” (heads) or a “T” (tails), corresponding to the top and second from the top nodes. Going down each branch, we get sample space of all the possible permutations of our two flips - <span class="math inline">\(\{HH,HT,TH,TT\}\)</span>. Our random experiment is now a selection from this new sample space.</p>
<p>Drawing a tree to determine all the permutations of multiple draws, could get quite cumbersome, so it’s convenient to have a formula. In the example above, the first flip could take 2 outcomes. After that, from the node of each of the two outcomes, the second flip could result in 2 additional outcomes each - e.g. <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2 = 4\)</span> possible permutations. That is to say, given a sample space of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> repeated samples, all the possible permutations would be given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:comp">\[ N^k
\tag{2.7}\]</span></p>
