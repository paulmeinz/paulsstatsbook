# Set Theory and Probability 

In the course of research, behavioral scientists will often take samples of human behavior, e.g. a survey of a group of people, measurements of reaction time, etc. Most researchers in the behavioral sciences understand the inherent randomness of this act. That is to say, you might take the exact same sample in a carefully controlled circumstance and get different results every time.

Suppose we have a circumstance where we can exactly describe every possible outcome of our sampling procedure. Then we repeatedly sample from this set of outcomes - careful to replicate the exact circumstances every time. In the field of probability and statistics this is called a **random experiment**. If done correctly, the samples that behavioral researchers take are analogous to this situation. One might describe a measurement they want to take  (describing the outcomes), and then take a sample of humans (or other creatures) to measure it (randomly sample). With this in mind, the purpose of this chapter is to provide a more concrete and mathematical description of this procedure. First, we'll start by learning about sets and set theory in order to describe our **sample space** and the form that samples may take. Then we'll more concretely define the randomness of our experiment by talking about **probability** - the quantification of randomness.
