# Set Theory and Probability 

In the course of research, behavioral scientists will often take samples of human behavior, e.g. a survey of a group of people, measurements of reaction time, etc. These samples will take some _outcome_, and most of us understand and have observed the inherent randomness of this act. That is to say, you might take the exact same sample in a carefully controlled circumstance and get different results every time.

Statisticians often refer to an analogous circumstance when talking about probability. Suppose we are able to describe all the possible outcomes of our sampling procedure. We take samples over and over again in the same circumstances, and each time the outcome changes. This is referred to as a **random experiment**. In order to familiarize you with some introductory concepts around probability, we're going to start in this context of a random experiment. First, we'll learn about sets and set theory in order to describe our **sample space**. This will also be useful in describing the form that outcomes of a random experiment may take. Then we'll more concretely define the randomness of our experiment by talking about **probability** - the quantification of randomness.

## Sets and Basic Set Theory

Before we get into it, we aren't going to learn set theory in it's entirety. That would be overly (and hilariously) ambitious. What we are going to learn will make understanding later sections easier, and maybe it'll make it a bit easier to understand set notation in other circumstances. The first step in conducting a random experiment is clearly defining all the possible outcomes of your sampling procedure. This is referred to as the **sample space**. Suppose we have five different possible outcomes in our sample space: A, B, C, D, and E. Let's call our sample space $S$. Then we would describe our sample space like this:

$$
S = \{A, B, C, D, E\}
(\#eq:discreteset)
$$
That is to say we'll describe the set $S$ with curly braces, and on the inside of the curly braces, there shall be a list of _distinct_ elements of our set. The sample space above is **discrete** - meaning it either contains a finite number of elements or it is _countable_. The definition of countable can be tricky to grasp at first, and if you don't understand it here, my hope is you have some intuition of it. Specifically, a discrete sample space can also be infinite - e.g. contain an infinite number of elements - so long as those elements can be lined up one-to-one with the natural numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, ...). This is probably not the most intuitive definition for people who don't think about mathematics every day (it certainly wasn't for me). In another, more intuitive sense, a discrete sample space - finite or infinite - has elements with nothing in between them. In $S$ above, there is nothing in between A and B, for example. If you can line up your set with the infinity of the natural numbers, then you couldn't find anything between members of that set either.

With that side point out of the way, we may also find ourselves sampling from a **continuous** sample space, e.g. all the values between and including 0 and 1 (e.g $0 \leq x \leq 1$). Since you can't enumerate all the values of a continuous sample space as we did $S$ (people have "tried"; we'll talk about one such example later), we use a different form of notation. Suppose we have a continuous sample space $R$, then we would specify it as

$$
T = \{x\, | \, 0 \leq x \leq 1 \}
(\#eq:continuousset)
$$

The inclusion criteria for the set is written after the $|$ in the curly braces. The $|$ can be read loosely as meaning "where", so reading the whole thing in the curly braces left to right you get x _where_ $0 \leq x \leq 1$. Therefore, our set is all the $x$'s from 0 to 1.

Now that we have discussed some more concrete ways of describing our sample space, let's talk about sampling from it. Suppose we are randomly drawing a single item from our sample space $S = \{A, B, C, D, E\}$. We shall call a particular outcome an _event_. Events are described by a *subset* of the sample space. For example, we might say the event is $C = \{A, B, C\}$, and if our sample lands in the that subset (as either A, B, or C), then we here I shall say that event was a success (congratulations all around!). You can indicate a set is a subset of another set by:

$$ C \subset S 
(\#eq:subset) $$

We might also, for example say that our event is a single element $C_1 = \{A\}$ or the entire sample space $C_2 = \{A,B,C,D,E\}$. We can be as creative as we would like to be, so long as the event is in our sample space. Speaking of creativity, suppose we have two events $C_1 = \{A,B,C\}$ and $C_2 = \{B,C,D\}$, and we are interested in whether or not our randomly sampled element lands in $C_1$ or $C_2$. Well, it's helpful here to consider the circumstances where this joint event occurs. Namely, If our realized element was an A, B, C, or D, then we would be successful (success!). That is to say, we've taken all the unique elements of either set and combined them into a new set. There's a handy symbol that indicates this operation:

$$ C_1 \cup C_1 = \{A,B,C\}\:\cup\:\{B,C,D\} = \{A,B,C,D\} 
(\#eq:intersect) $$

The *union operator* takes the unique elements of both sets and puts them into a set of their own. In this circumstance it is used synonymous with *or*. If the event of interest is our sample landing in $C_1$ OR $C_2$, then we would be successful if the event landed in the union of the two sets, e.g. all the unique elements from both sets. Here's another example, suppose we are interested in if our sample falls into $ C_1 = \{A\} $ or $ C_2 = \{B\} $. Then our event would occur if the element was A or B:

$$ \{A\}\:\cup\:\{B\} = \{A,B\} $$

The continuous case is pretty much the same although it takes some drawing of number lines if you are rusty with inequalities (no problem). Suppose we are sampling from a sample space $S = \{x\,|\,0 \leq x \leq 10 \}$ and we are interested in if the event lands in $C_1 = \{x\,|\,0 \leq x \leq 2 \}$ OR $C_2 = \{x\,|\,2 \leq x \leq 5 \}$. A successful sample here would occur if our sample landed anywhere from zero to five. In other words:

$$ \{0 \leq x \leq 2 \}\:\cup\:\{2 \leq x \leq 5\} = \{0 \leq x \leq 5\} $$
