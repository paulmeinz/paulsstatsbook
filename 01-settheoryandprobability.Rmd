# Set Theory and Probability 

In the course of research, behavioral scientists will often take samples of human behavior, e.g. a survey of a group of people, measurements of reaction time, etc. We (us researchers) take samples which have some _outcome_, but most of us understand and have observed the inherent randomness of this act. That is to say, you might take the exact same sample in a carefully controlled circumstance and get different results every time.

Statisticians often refer to an analogous circumstance when talking about probability. Suppose we are able to describe all the possible outcomes of our sampling procedure. We take samples over and over again in the same circumstances and study the result. This is referred to as a **random experiment**. In order to familiarize you with some introductory concepts around probability, we're going to start in the context of a random experiment. First, we'll learn about sets and set theory in order to describe our **sample space** and the form that outcomes may take. Then we'll more concretely define the randomness of our experiment by talking about **probability** - the quantification of randomness.

## Sets and Basic Set Theory

Before we get into it, we aren't going to learn set theory completely in this section. That would be overly ambitious. What we are going to learn will make understanding later sections easier, and maybe it'll make it a bit easier in the wild when you see sets referenced in other contexts. The first step in conducting a random experiment is clearly defining all the possible outcomes of your sampling procedure. This is referred to as the **sample space**. Suppose we have five different possible outcomes in our sample space: A, B, C, D, and E. Let's call our sample space S. Then we would describe our sample space like this:

\begin{equation*} 
S = \{1, 2, 3\}
\end{equation*}
